# History Log Implementation for Ticket Changes

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a comprehensive History Log system for all ticket changes in the Morpho Board application. The implementation includes a business layer for centralized history logging and covers all ticket operations.

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Business Layer Creation

**New Package**: `dev.vepo.morphoboard.ticket.business`

**New Service**: `TicketHistoryService`
- Centralized service for all history logging operations
- Uses dependency injection with `@ApplicationScoped`
- Provides specific methods for different types of ticket changes

### 2. History Logging Methods

The `TicketHistoryService` provides the following methods:

#### Core Operations
- `logTicketCreated(Ticket ticket, User user)` - Logs ticket creation
- `logTicketUpdated(Ticket ticket, User user, String changes)` - Logs ticket updates with field changes
- `logTicketDeleted(Ticket ticket, User user)` - Logs ticket deletion

#### Status Management
- `logStatusChanged(Ticket ticket, User user, String fromStatus, String toStatus)` - Logs status transitions

#### Assignment Management
- `logAssigneeChanged(Ticket ticket, User user, String fromAssignee, String toAssignee)` - Logs assignee changes
  - Handles assignment, unassignment, and reassignment scenarios

#### Category Management
- `logCategoryChanged(Ticket ticket, User user, String fromCategory, String toCategory)` - Logs category changes

#### Comment Management
- `logCommentAdded(Ticket ticket, User user)` - Logs comment additions

#### Future Extensibility
- `logPriorityChanged(Ticket ticket, User user, String fromPriority, String toPriority)` - For future priority field
- `logDueDateChanged(Ticket ticket, User user, String fromDueDate, String toDueDate)` - For future due date field
- `logTicketRestored(Ticket ticket, User user)` - For future soft delete implementation
- `logCustomAction(Ticket ticket, User user, String action)` - For custom actions

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Ticket Endpoint

The `TicketEndpoint` has been updated to use the new business service:

#### Changes Made:
- **Dependency Injection**: Added `TicketHistoryService` to the constructor
- **Create Operation**: Now logs ticket creation using `historyService.logTicketCreated()`
- **Update Operation**: Enhanced to track specific field changes (title, description, category)
- **Delete Operation**: Now logs ticket deletion before actual deletion
- **Move Operation**: Enhanced to track status changes with before/after values
- **Comment Addition**: Now logs comment additions
- **New Assignee Update**: Added new endpoint `/tickets/{id}/assignee` for assignee management

#### New Endpoint:
```java
@PATCH
@Path("/{id}/assignee")
public TicketResponse updateAssignee(@PathParam("id") Long id, @Valid UpdateAssigneeRequest request)
```

### 2. New Request Class

**New Class**: `UpdateAssigneeRequest`
```java
public record UpdateAssigneeRequest(@NotNull Long assigneeId) {}
```

### 3. Enhanced Update Logic

The ticket update method now:
- Tracks changes for each field (title, description, category)
- Only logs history when actual changes occur
- Provides detailed change descriptions

### 4. Comprehensive History Tracking

All ticket operations now generate appropriate history entries:

| Operation | History Description | Fields Tracked |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Create | "Ticket created" | N/A |
| Update | "Ticket updated: [field names]" | title, description, category |
| Delete | "Ticket deleted" | N/A |
| Status Change | "Status changed from 'X' to 'Y'" | status |
| Assignee Change | "Assigned to 'X'" / "Unassigned" / "Assignee changed from 'X' to 'Y'" | assignee |
| Category Change | "Category changed from 'X' to 'Y'" | category |
| Comment Add | "Comment added" | N/A |

## Testing

### 1. Business Service Tests

**New Test Class**: `TicketHistoryServiceTest`
- Tests all history logging methods
- Uses Quarkus test framework with `@QuarkusTest`
- Verifies service functionality without breaking existing tests

### 2. Existing Tests

- All existing `TicketEndpointTest` tests pass
- Fixed minor test assertion issue (category vs status field)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Benefits

### 1. Centralized History Management
- Single point of control for all history logging
- Consistent history entry format
- Easy to maintain and extend

### 2. Comprehensive Coverage
- All ticket operations are now logged
- Detailed change tracking for updates
- Proper user attribution for all actions

### 3. Future-Proof Design
- Extensible for new ticket fields (priority, due date, etc.)
- Support for custom actions
- Ready for soft delete implementation

### 4. Business Layer Separation
- Clear separation of concerns
- Business logic separated from endpoint logic
- Easier to test and maintain

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Ticket
```java
// Automatically logs: "Ticket created"
historyService.logTicketCreated(ticket, user);
```

### Updating a Ticket
```java
// Logs: "Ticket updated: title, description"
historyService.logTicketUpdated(ticket, user, "title, description");
```

### Changing Status
```java
// Logs: "Status changed from 'TODO' to 'In Progress'"
historyService.logStatusChanged(ticket, user, "TODO", "In Progress");
```

### Assigning a Ticket
```java
// Logs: "Assigned to 'John Doe'"
historyService.logAssigneeChanged(ticket, user, null, "John Doe");
```

## Database Schema

The existing `TicketHistory` entity is used:
- `id`: Primary key
- `ticket`: Reference to the ticket
- `user`: Reference to the user who performed the action
- `description`: Human-readable description of the change
- `timestamp`: When the change occurred

## API Endpoints

### Existing Endpoints (Enhanced)
- `POST /api/tickets` - Creates ticket (logs creation)
- `POST /api/tickets/{id}` - Updates ticket (logs changes)
- `DELETE /api/tickets/{id}` - Deletes ticket (logs deletion)
- `POST /api/tickets/{id}/move` - Moves ticket (logs status change)
- `POST /api/tickets/{id}/comments` - Adds comment (logs comment)

### New Endpoints
- `PATCH /api/tickets/{id}/assignee` - Updates assignee (logs assignee change)

## Migration Notes

- No database schema changes required
- Existing history entries remain unchanged
- All existing functionality preserved
- New history entries will have more detailed descriptions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Priority Field**: Add priority tracking when priority field is implemented
2. **Due Date Field**: Add due date tracking when due date field is implemented
3. **Soft Delete**: Implement soft delete with restoration logging
4. **Bulk Operations**: Add support for bulk ticket operations
5. **History Filtering**: Add filtering and search capabilities for history entries
6. **Email Notifications**: Integrate history logging with email notifications
7. **Audit Trail**: Enhance with more detailed audit information

## Conclusion

The History Log implementation provides a comprehensive, centralized, and extensible solution for tracking all ticket changes. The business layer approach ensures maintainability and testability while providing detailed audit trails for all ticket operations.
